Create a tile based map editor -- NOT COMPLETED
Integrate more tilesets from the spritesheet to the ImageManager class
Maybe for client-server connection handling, use a concurrentlinkedqueue in the java.util.concurrent package
Initialize images in ImageManager class using nested for loops rather than writing out all of them individually. create RenderTileset(int width, int height) method?
